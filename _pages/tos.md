# Ripple App End User License Agreement

This End User License Agreement (“Agreement”) is between you and Ripple and governs use of this app made available through the Apple App Store. By installing the Ripple App, you agree to be bound by this Agreement and understand that there is no tolerance for objectionable content or abusive behavior. If you do not agree with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you are not entitled to use the Ripple App.

In order to ensure Ripple provides the best experience possible for everyone, we strongly enforce a no-tolerance policy for objectionable content and abusive behavior. If you see inappropriate content, please use the "Report" feature found on each listings and user profile.

Additionally, as this is a C2C marketplace, users should be cautious and aware of potential scams. Ripple verifies transactions through QR codes, but does not have a payment system to ensure secure transactions. Users should be cautious when sharing information and giving away money, as Ripple holds no responsibility for any interactions or transactions between buyers and sellers.

1. Parties This Agreement is between you and Ripple only, and not Apple, Inc. (“Apple”). Notwithstanding the foregoing, you acknowledge that Apple and its subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement and Apple has the right to enforce this Agreement against you. Ripple, not Apple, is solely responsible for the Ripple App and its content.
